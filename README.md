### Example results  

![](results/cls_res.png)
- AUC curve (a) and precision-recall curve (b) for effectiveness analysis of the Entangle-Cls module and the ChannelAtten block in
CKDNet.

- Segmentation results with contours on the ISIC2017 test dataset. We choose six images from each lesion type, i.e., melanoma (MEL),
seborrheic keratosis (SBK), and nevus (NEV). Image name and lesion type are listed at the top of each image. Ground truth and our segmentation
results are shown by green and blue contours.
